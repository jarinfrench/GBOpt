"""Provide constrained, backend-aware artifact cleanup primitives.

This module owns validation of filesystem paths that GBOpt is explicitly allowed to
remove and the runtime dispatch boundary for evaluator-owned cleanup callbacks. It
consumes logical candidate/source metadata after the optimizer has declared an artifact
transient. Retention decisions, checkpoint commits, and backend-specific work-directory
